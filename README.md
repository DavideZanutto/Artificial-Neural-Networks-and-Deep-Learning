### Image Classification Challenge 🍃
The objective of this challenge was to correctly classify images of leafs based on the species of the plant they belong.<br />
We developed two different solutions for this problem :
* Convolutional Neural Network from scratch
* Transfer Learning approach with Adam optimiser

Our best score was 0.8402 obtain with Adam.<br />

### Time Series Classification ⏱️
The objective of this challenge was to correctly classify samples in the multivariate time series format. In other words, since this is a classification problem, the objective is to correctly map the information contained in the features calculated over time to their labels.
